Objective:
Understand the concept of inheritance and how it allows code reuse.
Learn about single and multiple inheritance in Python.
Grasp method resolution order (MRO) and its significance.
Apply polymorphism and method overriding in real-world scenarios.

Introduction to Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows one class (child/derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent/base class).

Single and Multiple Inheritance
Single Inheritance – One child inherits from one parent.
Multiple Inheritance – One child inherits from more than one parent.

Method Resolution Order (MRO)
MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes.

Polymorphism and Method Overriding
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object calling them.
Overriding: A derived class can redefine a method from the base class.
