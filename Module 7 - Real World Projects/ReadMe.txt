Code Organization and Modular Design
🎯 Objective:
Learn how to structure code into modules and packages for better readability, reusability, and maintainability.
🔍 Definition:
Modular design splits code into multiple files (modules), each handling a specific responsibility.
Helps with teamwork, debugging, and scaling large projects.

✅ Project Folder Structure Example:
calculator_app/
│
├── main.py             # Entry point
├── calculator.py       # Business logic
├── ui.py               # GUI code (optional)
├── utils/
│   └── helpers.py      # Helper functions
└── __init__.py         # Make folder a package

✅ Benefits:
Easier to debug and maintain
Promotes Separation of Concerns (SoC)
Supports reusability

Writing Clean and Maintainable OOP Code
🎯 Objective:
Adopt good OOP coding practices that make your code readable, testable, and scalable.

✅ Best Practices:
Principle	                        Description
SRP (Single Responsibility)	        Each class/module should have one responsibility
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)	        Avoid duplicating code logic
Encapsulation	                    Keep internal details private using _ or __
Naming	                            Use descriptive names for classes, methods, variables
Docstrings	                        Explain purpose of each class/function
Testing	                            Write small unit tests for core functionality

Creating a GUI Application Using OOP
🎯 Objective:
Create a desktop GUI app using object-oriented Python with tkinter.

✅ GUI Design Concepts:
Use a main window class to manage widgets.
Separate logic (calculator engine) from UI code (buttons, inputs).
Use layout managers (grid, pack, place) efficiently.

✅ Mini Project: OOP-Based Calculator with tkinter
📌 Objective:
Build a simple calculator GUI with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using OOP principles.
