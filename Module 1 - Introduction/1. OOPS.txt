1. Define OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)
	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” — which can contain data (attributes) and functions (methods) to operate on that data.

It helps you model real-world entities like cars, bank accounts, users, or animals as code structures.


2. Key Concepts of OOPS
There are 4 main pillars of OOP:

a) Encapsulation
Wrapping data and functions into a single unit (class) to hide internal details.

b) Abstraction
Showing only essential features and hiding unnecessary details.

c) Inheritance
One class (child) inherits the attributes and methods of another (parent).

d) Polymorphism
The ability to use a single function name to perform different tasks.

3. Advantages of OOPS
Advantage	Description
✅ Modularity	Code is divided into classes, making it organized and reusable.
✅ Reusability	Inheritance allows code reuse without rewriting logic.
✅ Scalability	Easy to maintain and scale large codebases.
✅ Security	Encapsulation protects internal data from unintended access.
✅ Abstraction	Hides complex implementation, exposing only what is necessary.
✅ Flexibility	Polymorphism allows easy code extension without breaking existing logic.
