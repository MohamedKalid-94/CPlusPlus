Module 5: Encapsulation and Abstraction

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Understand the concept of encapsulation and abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming.
Learn how to use public, protected, and private variables.
Implement abstraction using Abstract Base Classes (ABC).
Practice with real-life examples for better understanding.

Encapsulation
Definition:
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class). It is used to restrict access to the internal representation of the object to protect it from unauthorized changes.

Public, Protected, and Private Attributes
Type	          Syntax	    Access Level
Public	          self.var	    Accessible everywhere
Protected	      self._var	    Accessible in class and subclass
Private	          self.__var	Only accessible in the class

Abstraction (Using Abstract Base Classes)
Definition:
Abstraction is the concept of hiding internal details and showing only necessary features. It is used to define blueprints for other classes using abc module.
